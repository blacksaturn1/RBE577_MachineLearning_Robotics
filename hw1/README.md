## HW1: Constrained Control Allocation for Dynamic Ship Positioning Using Deep Neural Network

### Description
Implemented the algorithms and data studied in the paper:
> "Constrained control allocation for dynamic ship positioning using deep neural network"

### Setup
1. Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10.12:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source ./.venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running Training
Run:
```bash
python hw1/src/main.py
```

### Notes
- All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Results and outputs will be saved in the appropriate folders as defined in the code.
- For more details, refer to the main project README.
